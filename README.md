# COM430---TicTacToe-Project-with-AI-and-UI-Support
This is a dev ops project for a Software Engineering class. I have compiled this code for our group by using various tutorials and examining existing code from other
users on GitHub and other coding blog sites. This program is a simple TicTacToe game that is played with an AI player. - Tyler Koelsch

# Issues that need to be resolved:

Currently, the program does not have a clean UI and is using a placeholder one created from brackets. So, a UI needs to be implemented. - Tyler Koelsch
